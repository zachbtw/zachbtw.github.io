## Motivating Example - PJ Walker to DJ Moore

:::

## Motivating Questions

::: fragment
-   What would other quarterbacks do in this situation?
:::

::: fragment
-   Which quarterbacks deviate from the expected option the most?
    -   Do some quarterbacks find success in this deviation?
    -   Should some quarterbacks throw more typical passes?
:::

::: fragment
-   Look to build a ranking model to determine the most likely throw target
:::

## Data Overview {.smaller}

::::::::: columns
::::::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **2024 NFL Big Data Bowl – 2022 Season Weeks 1–9**

::: fragment
-   **Game and Play Data** – Teams, Score, Play Description, Game Context, Play Result, Changes in Win Probability
:::

::: fragment
-   **Player Play Data** – Statistics for each player for a play
    -   Route ran by player, Whether the player made a tackle or interception
:::

::: fragment
-   **Tracking Data** - Locations of players and the football at each frame of a play
:::

::: fragment
-   Exclusively looking at throwing plays with an obvious target
    -   Removing spikes and throwaways

## Deriving QB Line of Sight Prior to Throw

![](Slides_Assets/vision_example.gif)

## Methodology

::: fragment
-   Building a ranking algorithm(i.e. [XGBoost](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xgboost/xgboost.pdf)) using hand-crafted features to rank the likeliest recipient at a frame - 59.9 $\pm$ 0.5% top-1 accuracy
    -   Using a random hyperparameter search and 5-fold cross validation, with folds on matches
    -   Performs significantly stronger than naive random guess(20%) and choosing the player who is farthest from their closest defender(31%)
:::

::: fragment
-   Applying model to contextualize individual QB decisions by comparing them to model-predicted choices

## Feature Set {.smaller}

| Feature Category | Features |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Recipient Features** | \- *Distance (x, y, magnitude)\** <br> - *Speed Differences (x, y, magnitude)\** <br> - *Orientation Differences\** <br> - *Speed Vector Distance\** <br> - Receiver Position <br> - First Down Indicator <br> - Number of Defenders in Route-Runner's "Next 5 Yards"<br> - Angle between QB Orientation and Receiver 5 Frames Prior <br> |
| **Quarterback Features** | \- Distance from Receiver <br> - Movement Vector <br> - Under Pressure Indicator |
| **Game Context** | \- Quarter <br> - Down and Distance <br> - Score Differential <br> - Time Remaining |

<br><br>*\*Feature taken relative to the top-3 closest defenders*

## Potential Optimization Opportunities with More Conventional Passes

![](Slides_Assets/QBClustering_nt.png)
:::

## Discussion {.small}

::: fragment
-   Able to model the likely target using an XGBoost Ranking Model with strong predictive power
    -   Improvements from incorporating newer factors like receiver skill and pre-snap factors
:::

::: fragment
-   Reliance on proxies which could add bias to results
    -   Smaller dataset, only about 200 throws per quarterback
    -   Would like to model quarterback development throughout their career
